# Image Processing Lab Code

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code developed as part of an academic image processing laboratory. The code accompanies a written report and is intended to support the understanding and demonstration of fundamental image processing concepts, including image transforms, enhancement, compression, and restoration.

## Intended Use
All code in this repository is provided **strictly for learning and educational purposes only**.  
It was created specifically to support the submission of a laboratory report and to allow reviewers to inspect the implementation details referenced in that report.

## Usage Restrictions
- The code is **not intended for production use**.
- The code should **not be reused, redistributed, or repurposed** for assignments, commercial projects, or external applications.
- The repository exists solely to provide transparency and reproducibility for the associated academic report.

## Academic Context
The implementations are designed to illustrate core image processing principles rather than to provide optimised, general-purpose, or industrial-grade solutions. As such, emphasis is placed on clarity and experimentation rather than robustness or efficiency.

## Disclaimer
The author assumes no responsibility for any use of this code outside its stated educational purpose. Any use beyond learning, inspection, or report verification is explicitly discouraged.
